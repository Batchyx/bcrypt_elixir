  ## Bcrypt

  Bcrypt is a key derivation function for passwords designed by Niels Provos
  and David MaziÃ¨res. Bcrypt is an adaptive function, which means that it can
  be configured to remain slow and resistant to brute-force attacks even as
  computational power increases.

  The computationally intensive code is run in C, using Erlang NIFs. One concern
  about NIFs is that they block the Erlang VM, and so it is better to make
  sure these functions do not run for too long. This bcrypt implementation
  has been adapted so that each NIF runs for as short a time as possible.

  ## Bcrypt versions

  This bcrypt implementation is based on the latest OpenBSD version, which
  fixed a small issue that affected some passwords longer than 72 characters.
  By default, it produces hashes with the prefix `$2b$`, and it can check
  hashes with either the `$2b$` prefix or the older `$2a$` prefix.
  It is also possible to generate hashes with the `$2a$` prefix by running
  the following command:

      Bcrypt.Base.hash_password("hard to guess", Bcrypt.gen_salt(12, true))

  This option should only be used if you need to generate hashes that are
  then checked by older libraries.

  Generate a salt for use with the `Bcrypt.Base.hash_password` function.

  The log_rounds parameter determines the computational complexity
  of the generation of the password hash. Its default is 12, the minimum is 4,
  and the maximum is 31.

  The `legacy` option is for generating salts with the old `$2a$` prefix.
  Only use this option if you need to generate hashes that are then checked
  by older libraries.
